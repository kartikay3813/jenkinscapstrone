why used multibranch pipeline?
 Ans. The Multibranch Pipeline project type enables you to implement different Jenkinsfiles for different branches of the same project. 
       In a Multibranch Pipeline project, Jenkins automatically discovers, manages and executes Pipelines for branches which contain a 
       Jenkinsfile in source control.
       
 Q.  What is jenkinsfile?
 Ans. A Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline and is checked into source control
        The stages directive and steps directive are also required for a valid Declarative Pipeline as they instruct Jenkins what to execute and 
        in which stage it should be executed.
       
         
 Q.      what is webhook ?
 Ans.     webhook is a mechanism to automatically trigger the build of a Jenkins project upon a commit pushed in a Git repository. In order for builds 
          to be triggered automatically by PUSH and PULL REQUEST events, a Jenkins Web Hook needs to be added to each GitHub repository.
          
 Q.       what is poll scm?
 Ans.     polls the scm for checking if any changes/ new commits were made and shall build the project if any new commits were pushed since the last 
          build, whereas the "build" shall build the project periodically irrespective to whether or not any changes were made.
